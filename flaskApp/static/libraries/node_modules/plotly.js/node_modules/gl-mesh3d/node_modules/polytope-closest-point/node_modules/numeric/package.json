  "readme": "Numeric Javascript by Sébastien Loisel\n======================================\n\nNumeric Javascript is a javascript library for doing numerical\nanalysis in the browser. Because Numeric Javascript uses only the\njavascript programming language, it works in many browsers and does\nnot require powerful servers.\n\nNumeric Javascript is for building \"web 2.0\" apps that can perform\ncomplex calculations in the browser and thus avoid the latency of\nasking a server to compute something. Indeed, you do not need a\npowerful server (or any server at all) since your web app will perform\nall its calculations in the client.\n\nFor further information, see http://www.numericjs.com/\nDiscussion forum: http://groups.google.com/group/numericjs\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nNumeric Javascript is copyright by Sébastien Loisel and is distributed\nunder the MIT license. Details are found in the license.txt file.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThere are no dependencies for numeric.js.\n\nSubdirectories\n--------------\n\nHere are some of the subdirectories and their contents:\n\n* / holds the html/php files for the workshop/web site, license.txt, README, etc...\n\n* /src holds the source files. The .js files are concatenated together to produce lib/numeric.js\n\n* /lib holds numeric.js and numeric-min.js. These files aren't checked into the git tree because\nthey are created from the files in the /src subdirectory.\n\n* /resources holds some small images, css files, etc...\n\n* /tools contains build/test scripts. If you're going to patch or otherwise make tweaks to numeric,\nyou will need to use the /tools/build.sh script. There are also a bunch of scripts to deploy to\nthe numericjs.com web site, which you probably won't need.\n\nBuilding and testing\n--------------------\n\nIf you tweak the code, you can build and test the library by running the script /tools/build.sh. If you plan\nto send me patches, please at least run this build script and check that all the tests pass.\n",
